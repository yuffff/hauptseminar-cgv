abstract = {Molecular graphics systems are visualization tools which, upon integration into a 3D immersive environment, provide a unique virtual reality experience for research and teaching of biomolecular structure, function and interactions. We have developed a molecular structure and dynamics application, the Molecular Dynamics Visualization tool, that uses the Unity game engine combined with large scale, multi-user, stereoscopic visualization systems to deliver an immersive display experience, particularly with a large cylindrical projection display. The application is structured to separate the biomolecular modeling and visualization systems. The biomolecular model loading and analysis system was developed as a stand-alone C{\#} library and provides the foundation for the custom visualization system built in Unity. All visual models displayed within the tool are generated using Unity-based procedural mesh building routines. A 3D user interface was built to allow seamless dynamic interaction with the model while being viewed in 3D space. Biomolecular structure analysis and display capabilities are exemplified with a range of complex systems involving cell membranes, protein folding and lipid droplets.},

abstract = {Tracing neurons in large-scale microscopy data is crucial to establishing a wiring diagram of the brain, which is needed to understand how neural circuits in the brain process information and generate behavior. Automatic techniques often fail for large and complex datasets, and connectomics researchers may spend weeks or months manually tracing neurons using 2D image stacks. We present a design study of a new virtual reality (VR) system, developed in collaboration with trained neuroanatomists, to trace neurons in microscope scans of the visual cortex of primates. We hypothesize that using consumer-grade VR technology to interact with neurons directly in 3D will help neuroscientists better resolve complex cases and enable them to trace neurons faster and with less physical and mental strain. We discuss both the design process and technical challenges in developing an interactive system to navigate and manipulate terabyte-sized image volumes in VR. Using a number of different datasets, we demonstrate that, compared to widely used commercial software, consumer-grade VR presents a promising alternative for scientists.},

@article{Donalek2014,
abstract = {Effective data visualization is a key part of the discovery process in the era of "big data". It is the bridge between the quantitative content of the data and human intuition, and thus an essential component of the scientific path from data into knowledge and understanding. Visualization is also essential in the data mining process, directing the choice of the applicable algorithms, and in helping to identify and remove bad data from the analysis. However, a high complexity or a high dimensionality of modern data sets represents a critical obstacle. How do we visualize interesting structures and patterns that may exist in hyper-dimensional data spaces? A better understanding of how we can perceive and interact with multi-dimensional information poses some deep questions in the field of cognition technology and human-computer interaction. To this effect, we are exploring the use of immersive virtual reality platforms for scientific data visualization, both as software and inexpensive commodity hardware. These potentially powerful and innovative tools for multi-dimensional data visualization can also provide an easy and natural path to a collaborative data visualization and exploration, where scientists can interact with their data and their colleagues in the same visual space. Immersion provides benefits beyond the traditional "desktop" visualization tools: it leads to a demonstrably better perception of a datascape geometry, more intuitive data understanding, and a better retention of the perceived relationships in the data.},

abstract = {We present an approach for rendering the surface of a particle-based fluid that is simple to implement, has real-time performance with a configurable speed/quality trade-off, and smoothes the surface to prevent the fluid from looking "blobby" or jelly-like. The method is not based on polygonization and as such circumvents the usual grid artifacts of marching cubes. It only renders the surface where it is visible, and has inherent view-dependent level-of-detail. We use Perlin noise to add detail to the surface of the fluid. All the processing, rendering and shading steps are directly implemented on graphics hardware.},

Virtual reality (VR) applications rely on high frame rates (i.e., around 90 fps as opposed to 30 - 60 fps) and show high sensitivity to any kind of visual artifacts, which are typical for 3D point cloud depictions (e.g., holey surfaces or visual clutter due to inappropriate point sizes). We present a novel rendering system that allows for an immersive, nausea-free exploration of arbitrary large 3D point clouds on state-of-the-art VR devices such as HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Our approach applies several point-based and image-based rendering techniques that are combined using a multipass rendering pipeline. The approach does not require to derive generalized, mesh-based representations in a preprocessing step and preserves precision and density of the raw 3D point cloud data. The presented techniques have been implemented and evaluated with massive real-world data sets from aerial, mobile, and terrestrial acquisition campaigns containing up to 2.6 billion points to show the practicability and scalability of our approach.},

	doi = {10.1109/IPDPSW.2016.121},
	abstract = {Immersive molecular visualization provides the viewer with intuitive perception of complex structures and spatial relationships that are of critical interest to structural biologists. The recent availability of commodity head mounted displays (HMDs) provides a compelling opportunity for widespread adoption of immersive visualization by molecular scientists, but HMDs pose additional challenges due to the need for low-latency, high-frame-rate rendering. State-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations produce terabytes of data that can be impractical to transfer from remote supercomputers, necessitating routine use of remote visualization. Hardware-accelerated video encoding has profoundly increased frame rates and image resolution for remote visualization, however round-trip network latencies would cause simulator sickness when using HMDs. We present a novel two-phase rendering approach that overcomes network latencies with the combination of omnidirectional stereoscopic progressive ray tracing and high performance rasterization, and its implementation within VMD, a widely used molecular visualization and analysis tool. The new rendering approach enables immersive molecular visualization with rendering techniques such as shadows, ambient occlusion lighting, depth-of-field, and high quality transparency, that are particularly helpful for the study of large biomolecular complexes. We describe ray tracing algorithms that are used to optimizeinteractivity and quality, and we report key performance metrics of the system. The new techniques can also benefit many other application domains.},
