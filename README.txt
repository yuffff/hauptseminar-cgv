we are going to use egpaper_final.tex to do our work .
the output file is egpaper_final.pdf 

p:
1.when adding ref. , use unsrt style instead of ieee style .
2.compile more than one time and ensure there is only one warning message to view the result file

attention:
most of my work is done in review.tex
do not forget to add the pictures when merging 
first version of review on my part , "[x]" should be replaced when adding references!
there will be changes later
