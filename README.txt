we are going to use egpaper_final.tex to do our work .
the output file is egpaper_final.pdf 

p:
1.when adding ref. , use unsrt style instead of ieee style .
2.compile more than one time and ensure there is only one warning message to view the result file

Hi,

thank you for your submission! I have read it and it is good but I have 
the feeling, that is it quite hard for you to bring all the different 
approaches together since there are so many. (Correct me if I am wrong)

I would recommend you (because I think this makes things easier for you) 
that you structure the final paper the following way:

- (new) overall goal: present 4-5 different immersive visualization 
approaches with focus on the use of HMDs. Of course can you use the 
already given three paper
- for each approach write about the used rendering techniques and their 
problems and about the user interaction concept in VR. there you can 
also cite some of the interesting references of your chosen paper
- remove the current display part (because it is not so related to VR 
vis with HMDs)
- include images (since your paper will not be published you do not need 
to ask for permission of the original author)

Such that you get something like the following structure:

1. Intro
	- your intro is good :)
	- you may want to add some short sentences about the projects you will 
present

2. Point-Cloud Vis in VR
2.1 overview
	- project description and goal
	- similarities and differences to the other projects
2.2 Rendering
	- used techniques (volume rendering, raycasting...)
	- difficulties and their solutions
2.3 Interaction concept
	- how do they use the immersive setting (interact in VR with controller 
like touching objects or just viewing the data etc)

3. Tracing in VR
4. Molecular Vis in VR
...

7. conclusion
	- trends & similarities between the projects
	- future work (what is not working right now)

I hope this helps you. Of course you don't have to stick to this. If you 
have any questions feel free to ask. We could also meet if you want to 
discuss the structure.

And just as a reminder: please keep in mind that in the end you have to 
tell who was responsible for which part such that you can get individual 
grades.

Greetings,
Franzi
