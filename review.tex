\section{Introduction}
%The use of stereoscopic images can improve the depth cue and the perception of the spatial relationships which might be crucial for scientist when analyzing data.
Scientific Visualization is the visualization of scientific phenomena. The purpose is to enable scientists to understand, illustrate and get insight from their data. The data arising from observations or simulations has an implicit or explicit geometric structure, is often very large and most of the time in 3D. Phenomena that can be visualized include the visualization of particles, terrain, volume, flow and tensors.

\setlength{\parindent}{1pc}Virtual reality (VR) can give a sense of presence or immersion in 3D environments. It is a class of computer-controlled multisensory communication technologies that allow more intuitive interactions with data and involve human senses in new ways. An illusion of a three-dimensional world is generated with a stereoscopic head-tracked display system. Nowadays head mounted displays (HMDs) like Oculus Rift1 or HTC Vive2 are widely available and there fore also used in scientific visualization. There are also VR systems like the CAVE \cite{cruz1992cave}: an immersive virtual reality environment where projectors are directed to between three and six of the walls of a room-sized cube. It uses motion capture system, which records the real time position of the user, for interaction. VR-systems provide many of the depth cues which we use in the real world, such as binocular disparity and head-motion-parallax. The perception of spatial relationships is highly improved in comparison to 2D displays. When using VR for Scientific visualization, scientists can explore the data in ways which might lead to insights they would otherwise not get because of the increased depth perception and improved interaction with the studied object/phenomena. 

\setlength{\parindent}{1pc}Earliest publications about VR in scientific visualization can be found in the 1990s. Steve Bryson \cite{bryson1994virtual} discusses the use of VR in Scientific Visualization in 1994. He basically concluded that virtual environments provide significant advantages for complex three-dimensional phenomena but drawbacks were high cost of hardware. As technologies evolved costs decrease and display resolutions are higher, VR technologies provide better immersion into a virtual worlds than back in the 90s. Since there has been done a lot of research on this topic in the past decades, we will focus on four new projects from the last 6 years, which are more relevant for today research. Those projects are using different forms of visualizations: particle visualization, point-cloud visualization and volume visualization. Three of them are using HMDs and one is for CAVE2 \cite{febretti2013cave2}. We will discuss the rendering techniques and interaction techniques each approach is using.

\setlength{\parindent}{1pc}The paper can be divided into 6 chapters. In the second chapter we will present point cloud visualization \cite{discher_point-based_2018}. That one is followed by Tracing Neurons \cite{}. Chapter 4 will discuss an approach of molecular visualization \cite{}. Chapter 5 describes the techniques used for the visualization of atomistic simulations \cite{reda_visualizing_2013}. The last part will conclude the topic.

\section{Point Cloud Visualization}
\subsection{Overview}
Discher et al. \cite{discher_point-based_2018} utilized a multi-pass rendering pipeline to visualize 3D Point clouds with different rendering techniques on VR Head Mounted Displays. 3D point clouds are data sets which come from 3D scans e.g. via Airborne (Fig. \ref{fig:pointcloud_1}), Terrestrial or Mobile Laser scanning. They are used in areas like geospatial and non-geospatial applications, building information modeling, urban planning and cultural heritage. Real time rendering of 3D points clouds allows for interactive exploring of real-world assets, sites or regions. As this field has to deal with high amount of data the main challenge is to balance between render quality and performance. In VR on HMDs the applications have to cope with additional problems: very high framerates (90fps as opposed to 30-60fps) and high sensivity to any kind of visual artifacts which are typical for showing 3D Point Clouds(e.g holey surfaces and visual clutter). It is a project that allows for exploration of 3D point clouds with VR devices such as HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. The algorithm was tested with up to 2.6 billion points. The goal of this project was to show the scalability and practicability of the approach. This project is similar to the approaches which are explained in section 3 and 4 as it is designed for Visualization on VR-devices rather than an immersive environment like introduced in the approach in section 5. That is the main similarity, the other approaches focus for on Rendering of surfaces or volumes rather than point clouds.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Rendering}
A variety of optimization techniques for rendering was implemented to cope with the performance and visual problems arise when rendering massive 3D point clouds especially on VR devices. Former approaches had to reduce the precision and density of the data by thinning the point-clouds \cite{kreylos2008immersive} or converting them into generalized 3D meshes \cite{berger2017survey}. The rendering system of the introduced approach consists of three basic steps: data subset selection, point cloud rendering and image-based post processing.

\setlength{\parindent}{1pc}Data subset selection is necessary because presentation and interactive visualization of 3D point clouds have to deal with the massive amount of data which generally exceeds available CPU and GPU capabilities. For this reason out-of-core rendering concepts and spatial data structures are required. The 3D Point cloud can be subdivided in a representative subset which can be used for real time rendering. Here they determine the subset on a per-frame basis. Here two culling techniques were used. Points outside the view frustum are excluded. The second technique they used, is detail culling. Very small details contribute little. If the estimated area of an object is below a certain pixel threshold, the object is discarded. As an explicit Level-of-Detail(LoD) structure to provide efficient access to the data they are using kd-trees. It is a binary tree whose splitting planes can be chosen on the respective coordinate axes. This allows for minimal traversal times during rendering and the tree structure is balanced independent of the spatial position of points. Other acceleration data structures which have been used for Point cloud rendering are quadtrees \cite{Gao:2014:VAL:2619648.2619672} or octrees \cite{kreylos2008immersive}. Schuetz et al. \cite{schuetz-2019-CLOD} proposed a different approach for rendering points clouds in VR. They used a continuous level-of-detail structure instead of an explicit one. A flat array is used as a data structure with the hierarchy level stored in an attribute. It exhibits gradual rather than sudden changes in density. It addresses the issue which comes due to chunked LoD representation. It avoids hierarchical traversal, as no tree structure is used. The change of detail is less noticeable. But this approach is limited to point-clouds that fit in GPU memory.

\setlength{\parindent}{1pc}The next step Discher et al. \cite{discher_point-based_2018} called point cloud rendering. The data subset is rendered into g-buffers that combine multiple 2D textures (color, depth, normal). During run-time, it is possible to select different rendering techniques and change the appearance of the point cloud. They implemented three different rendering techniques to evaluate the performance. First one is the Hidden mesh rendering (Fig. \ref{fig:pointcloud_2}). The actual visible area on screen on VR devices is restricted to a circular area. To prevent a lot of unnecessary fragment shader operations, a mesh representing the hidden parts of the screen as a mask is used to discard those fragments early on \cite{vlachos_advanced_2015} with early fragment testing. That is possible by using the depth or stencil buffer, which is executed before the fragment shader when using early fragment testing. Next technique that was implemented is the reverse painters algorithm \cite{foley1996computer}, which is a GPU-based occlusion culling technique based on early fragment testing. Scene objects should be rendered in order of their distance to the view position for the technique to have a measurable effect. That is done on a per node basis of the kd-tree rather than per point bases to increase performance. Both of these techniques improved the performance but it varies depending on the number of fragments. The third rendering technique is single-pass stereo rendering, which has the goal to reduce the CPU-overhead by rendering both views of right and left eye in a single render pass \cite{johansson2016efficient}. The frame buffer size is doubled, as each half is assigned to one eye. Instanced rendering, which is a way to render multiple instances of a object in a single draw call and provide each instance with some unique attributes, is used to prevent duplicated draw calls. This technique proved to be less effective because the main performance bottleneck was the GPU rather than the CPU. 

\setlength{\parindent}{1pc}In addition to those, Discher et al. \cite{discher_point-based_2018} implemented two rendering techniques that are supposed to improve the image quality. That is necessary as the impressiveness of a scene is negatively effected by any kind of visual artifact one would not expect in the real world. The most noticeable artifacts due to inappropriately sized points are the holey appearance of surfaces or visual clutter. One technique that was used is the adaptive point size, which works on a per node basis of the kd-tree. For each node they determine its deepest descendant that has been selected for rendering. To all its ancestors the adaptive point size is applied. The point sizes are calculated based on a nodeâ€™s bounding box rather than its LoD, since nodes of the same LoD might still have quit different point densities. But the visual artifacts are not completely removed. Another rendering technique which was applied is paraboloid rendering \cite{schutz2016potree}. It aims to reduce the visual clutter further by rendering points as paraboloids oriented towards the viewing direction rather than screen aligned disks. A depth offset is added to fragments, which is depending from the distance to the corresponding point's center. Undesired occlusions are reduced significantly. But it is not compatible with the rendering techniques using early fragment testing, because the depth is modified in the fragment shader. This technique should only be used carefully as it decreases the performance significantly.

\setlength{\parindent}{1pc}The final step of the used rendering pipeline is imaged-based post processing. It operates on previously generated g-buffers. The post processing should improve the image quality further. Those techniques are Screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO)(effiently approximates the ambient occlusion effect in real-time) \cite{mittring2007finding} and eye-dome lighting (EDL) \cite{boucheny2009interactive}, which add depth cues and highlight silhouettes, blurring \cite{lukin2016tips}, which smooths aliasing and z-fighting (two or more primitives have similar or identical values in the z-buffer). Furthermore, remaining holes are filled and two one-dimensional filter kernels \cite{dobrev2010image} instead of a single two dimensional one for a performance speed up, are applied. The authors of the paper suggested to not use every image improvement techniques as they would slow down the rendering a lot.

\subsection{Interaction}
The VR environment is not only used for displaying. Controllers are used for interaction to improve the experience and exploration. Rotating and scaling of the rendered data is supported, as well as measuring distance between points, and selection of applied rendering technique and color.
\subsection{Conclusion}
The multi-pass approach offers a maximum degree of freedom as rendering techniques can be adjusted at runtime. It is highly beneficial for applications in digital documentation, preservation, and presentation of natural and cultural heritage, because it allows user to remotely explore. Future work can focus on performance improvements by distributing the stereo rendering across two separate GPUs.

\section{Visualization of Atomistic Simulations}
\subsection{Overview}
In this project \cite{reda_visualizing_2013} they present an application for interactive visualization and exploration of large-scale atomistic simulations in ultra-resolution immersive environments on CAVE2 \cite{febretti2013cave2}. Molecular Dynamics is a principle methodology in the study of nanoscale systems in applications of alternative fuel or energy storage. Computational chemists, physicists, and materials scientists evaluated the  system. Even though there are a lot of molecular visualization techniques atomistic simulations remain difficult because complex structures with millions of atoms need to be visualized. Here they are using a hybrid representation which combines a ball-and-stick glyph with volumetric surfaces to show the uncertainty in molecular boundaries at the nanoscale. Their algorithm scales well for the visualization of 5 million atoms at 15 FPS. The goals of the project where to show the scalability and the desire to highlight emergent high-level features in the molecular structure. Furthermore, they wanted to enable scientists to explore different boundary interpretations of the atoms or molecules. This approach has some similarities to the project of chapter 4 as molecules are visualized. Furthermore the project of chapter 3 has some similarities as it visualizing volumetric data as well, but is using isosurface rendering.

\end{figure}
The main techniques they used are ray-casting and volume rendering. Ray-casting is a rendering technique that is done pixel-wise. For every pixel a ray from the viewer is evaluated for intersecting objects. Direct volume rendering is a technique to show a volume data set. Therefore for every sample value is mapped to a opacity and a color via a transfer function. They employed  direct volume rendering to render the approximate electron densities with the use of a conventional transfer function to assign colors and opacities. This enables  a variety of visual representations by varying the transfer function which then allows for a flexible interpretation of the molecular boundaries.

As a data structure to represent ball-and-stick glyphs a uniform 'Macrocells' 3D grid stored in the GPU is employed. Each voxel in the grid stores information about all of the atoms and bonds, which are within the cell. The ray-casting algorithm \cite{Amanatides87afast} traverses each voxel at a discrete level. Because the list of glyphs in a cell is not depth ordered the algorithm has to test every primitive (sphere or cylinder) against the ray. After a hit is found, the surface is Phong-shaded. Afterward the charge density volume is sampled within the current cell and the color is accumulated according to the transfer function. They either used a precomputed electron density grid or a real-time density computation on the GPU. Using precomputed values the algorithm was 2-3 times faster which was no surprise as the computation is quite expensive.

To speed up rendering, an in-core solution was applied. Multiple GPU nodes are used. In the CAVE2 \cite{febretti2013cave2} system they employed a 36-node-cluster to render the immersive visualization on 72 LCD panels in parallel. Stereoscopic rendering is achieved by rendering and interleaving two images separated by the average inter-pupillary distance. To support correct viewing for multiple individuals, they normalized the head orientation when tracking, so that the eyes are always parallel to the screens surface. That might lead to small distortions between the tiles but it is a good compromise. The Ray-cast is done users head to each panel.



\subsection{Interaction}
CAVE2 \cite{febretti2013cave2} provides 3D Navigation using a 6 degrees-of-freedom joystick coupled with head-tracking. The user can fly through the simulation by using a button and by moving/rotating the joystick in the desired direction. The head-tracking provides a user-centered perspective. The user can also adjust the transfer function interactively by the wireless wand or via a tablet. The modification updates the visualization in real-time.
