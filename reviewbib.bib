	abstract = {Real-time rendering for 3D point clouds allows for interactively exploring and inspecting real-world assets, sites, or regions on a broad range of devices but has to cope with their vastly different computing capabilities. Virtual reality (VR) applications rely on high frame rates (i.e., around 90 fps as opposed to 30 - 60 fps) and show high sensitivity to any kind of visual artifacts, which are typical for 3D point cloud depictions (e.g., holey surfaces or visual clutter due to inappropriate point sizes). We present a novel rendering system that allows for an immersive, nausea-free exploration of arbitrary large 3D point clouds on state-of-the-art VR devices such as HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Our approach applies several point-based and image-based rendering techniques that are combined using a multipass rendering pipeline. The approach does not require to derive generalized, mesh-based representations in a preprocessing step and preserves precision and density of the raw 3D point cloud data. The presented techniques have been implemented and evaluated with massive real-world data sets from aerial, mobile, and terrestrial acquisition campaigns containing up to 2.6 billion points to show the practicability and scalability of our approach.},

	doi = {10.1109/IPDPSW.2016.121},
	abstract = {Immersive molecular visualization provides the viewer with intuitive perception of complex structures and spatial relationships that are of critical interest to structural biologists. The recent availability of commodity head mounted displays (HMDs) provides a compelling opportunity for widespread adoption of immersive visualization by molecular scientists, but HMDs pose additional challenges due to the need for low-latency, high-frame-rate rendering. State-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations produce terabytes of data that can be impractical to transfer from remote supercomputers, necessitating routine use of remote visualization. Hardware-accelerated video encoding has profoundly increased frame rates and image resolution for remote visualization, however round-trip network latencies would cause simulator sickness when using HMDs. We present a novel two-phase rendering approach that overcomes network latencies with the combination of omnidirectional stereoscopic progressive ray tracing and high performance rasterization, and its implementation within VMD, a widely used molecular visualization and analysis tool. The new rendering approach enables immersive molecular visualization with rendering techniques such as shadows, ambient occlusion lighting, depth-of-field, and high quality transparency, that are particularly helpful for the study of large biomolecular complexes. We describe ray tracing algorithms that are used to optimizeinteractivity and quality, and we report key performance metrics of the system. The new techniques can also benefit many other application domains.},
