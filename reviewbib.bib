	abstract = {Real-time rendering for 3D point clouds allows for interactively exploring and inspecting real-world assets, sites, or regions on a broad range of devices but has to cope with their vastly different computing capabilities. Virtual reality (VR) applications rely on high frame rates (i.e., around 90 fps as opposed to 30 - 60 fps) and show high sensitivity to any kind of visual artifacts, which are typical for 3D point cloud depictions (e.g., holey surfaces or visual clutter due to inappropriate point sizes). We present a novel rendering system that allows for an immersive, nausea-free exploration of arbitrary large 3D point clouds on state-of-the-art VR devices such as HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Our approach applies several point-based and image-based rendering techniques that are combined using a multipass rendering pipeline. The approach does not require to derive generalized, mesh-based representations in a preprocessing step and preserves precision and density of the raw 3D point cloud data. The presented techniques have been implemented and evaluated with massive real-world data sets from aerial, mobile, and terrestrial acquisition campaigns containing up to 2.6 billion points to show the practicability and scalability of our approach.},

	abstract = {Tracing neurons in large-scale microscopy data is crucial to establishing a wiring diagram of the brain, which is needed to understand how neural circuits in the brain process information and generate behavior. Automatic techniques often fail for large and complex datasets, and connectomics researchers may spend weeks or months manually tracing neurons using 2D image stacks. We present a design study of a new virtual reality (VR) system, developed in collaboration with trained neuroanatomists, to trace neurons in microscope scans of the visual cortex of primates. We hypothesize that using consumer-grade VR technology to interact with neurons directly in 3D will help neuroscientists better resolve complex cases and enable them to trace neurons faster and with less physical and mental strain. We discuss both the design process and technical challenges in developing an interactive system to navigate and manipulate terabyte-sized image volumes in VR. Using a number of different datasets, we demonstrate that, compared to widely used commercial software, consumer-grade VR presents a promising alternative for scientists.},

The immersive environment can improve user experiences in visualization, calculation, and editing of complex structures with more intuitive perception. VRmol is also a system with cloud-based capability to directly access disease-related databases, and couples the structure with genomic variation as well corresponding drugs information in a visual interface, thus serving as an integrative platform to aid structure-based translational research and drug design.
